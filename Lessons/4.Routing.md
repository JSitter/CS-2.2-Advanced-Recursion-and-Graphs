## [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mvH1YpsiDTl8T_fB6xYF_gkwF_M11DDCme8Agd0EACc/edit?usp=sharing)

## Why you should know this...
One of the most common applications of graph theory is to find and optimize a route between two vertices.


## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Implement common graph routing and path algorithms
1. Implement Dijkstra's Algorithm using a priority queue.
1. Compare and Contrast Dijkstra's algorithm to other shortest path algorithm.

## Review [15 min]
- Code review of shortest path.

## Overview 1: Dijkstra's Algorithm [20 min]

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

**[Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)** is a shortest path algorithm that visits neighbors one by one and assigns them a distance value based on the cumulative weights of the shortest path to get to that neighbor. Distances are updated if a shorter path can be found, so that once the target node is reached the shortest path is also computed.


### Priority Queues
Dijkstra's algorithm relies on Priority Queues to keep track of the current best distance.

- See [CS 2.1 Priority Queues](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/CS-2.1-Advanced-Trees-and-Sorting-Algorithms/blob/master/Lessons/Heaps.md) for more resources
